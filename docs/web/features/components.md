# `components/` (optional)

UI that's tightly coupled to this feature: it renders this feature's data,
calls this feature's hooks, or needs this feature's store. If two features
would end up wanting the same component, it doesn't belong here — move it
to `src/components/` instead (see [../components.md](../components.md)).

## What lives here

Looking at existing features (`llm`, `api-key`, `chat`), the recurring
shapes are:

- **CRUD dialogs**, one file per action:
  `create-<feature>-dialog.tsx`, `update-<feature>-dialog.tsx`,
  `delete-<feature>-dialog.tsx`. Each is a `DialogInstanceProps`-shaped
  component (see [../lib.md](../lib.md#dialog)) that calls the matching
  `hooks.ts` mutation and closes itself via the injected `close()` prop on
  success.
- **A table/list**, `<feature>-table.tsx`, driving `useList<Feature>` from
  `hooks.ts` and rendering rows with per-row actions that open the CRUD
  dialogs above.
- **Form fields**, `<feature>-form-fields.tsx`, shared between the create
  and update dialogs when they use the same react-hook-form fields (see
  `components/form` in [../components.md](../components.md)).
- **Guards**, `<feature>-guard.tsx`, when the feature is what an area of
  the app is gated on (`api-key-guard.tsx`, `chat-guard.tsx` — see
  [../routes.md](../routes.md)). A guard lives with the feature that owns
  the auth check, not under `routes/`, because it reads that feature's
  store/hooks directly.

## Imports

- Import this feature's own `hooks`/`schemas`/`store` with relative paths
  (`../hooks`, `../store`).
- Import generic, reusable pieces from `@/components` (`Button`, `Dialog`,
  `Page`, `SchemaFormDialog`, `FormInput`, ...) — don't reimplement design
  system primitives inside a feature.
- Don't import another feature's `components/` — if the UI is generic
  enough to be needed elsewhere, it should move to `@/components` instead.
